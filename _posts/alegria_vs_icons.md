<!--
	Corporate Art (Alegria) vs. Iconography
	- Lack of telos
	- Both are memetic
	- Somaticism/hedonism
		- what else would you use for marketing?
			- a sufferring christ?
	- Western notion that 'styles' are bad and the individual artist is important
		- They aren't. Styles indicate sustainability and development and tradition
		- Diversity isn't inherently good, but nondiversity allows for examination, analysis, and development
	- Cheapness: flatness versus texture
	- Maximalist Minimalism / Divine Simplicity
	
	"Kitsch": Lacking all critical distance between object and observer, "offers instantaneous emotional gratification without intellectual effort, without the requirement of distance, without sublimation"
		- Sublimation: transmission between material and divine without the intermediary of reason

The [Alegria](https://buck.co/work/facebook-alegria) style has become something of a meme. Well, mocking it has. Some have dubbed it ['globohomo' (globalist homogenization)](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=globohomo+art&t=h_&iax=images&ia=images) (use duckduckgo, not Google, for best results) and have memed it nicely.

A huge portion of people's complaint over this style, is, make no mistake, the messenger: tech corporations (big, small, VC-backed, etc). The mom and pop diner down the street doesn't have these flat, disproportioned humanoids plastered over their walls.

> Yeah I like it as well, but I think its because its associated with big tech companies that try to be relatable with cringey captions such as "we are all in this together"

But there's more to it than association. And it's not just about swoopy silly images. If there's one common braid among human 'art' it's strange images. [Everyone loves a good butt trumpet](https://www.sadanduseless.com/tubas/). There's something else that makes Alegria mere graphic design, and not art. Comparing it to western art of the past 4-5 centuries, of course, is like comparing apples to oranges, though... we need more similar fruit.

## Realism?

Art doesn't have to be realistic. Some of my favorite- the Byzantine style- is _notoriously_ grotesque (at least, to the uninitated) and unrealistic. I'm by no means an expert in iconography. I'll leave that [to others](https://orthodoxartsjournal.org/), but don't see a lot of people drawing the comparison between icons and globohomo so here we are.

![Icon of St. Katherine](/_assets/images/icon_st_katherine.jpg)

The distortion of icons is something which serves a more practical purpose in the context of liturgical or divine images. You are probably familiar with the [iconoclast heresy](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07620a.htm) or at least understand the general idea of 'thou shalt not make graven images'. We the viewers immediately recognize the distortion, and register that this is _not_ the thing itself. It is a representation, or better yet, a _window_ (a window to heaven, one might say).

## All Media is A Lens.

All media is a window into the underlying subject. Even photography is a distortion of the subject insofar as we are given a particular exposure, framing, angle, depth-of-field, and so on. We will not grasp the whole subject. But grasping the subject in its entirety is a vain exercise: not every detail is important. Thus, distortion is not in and of itself bad. Distortion can be used to highlight and emphasize particular elements. 

In the Byzantine (and pre-renaissance western) style, this distortion is embraced primarilly in distortion of sizes, resulting in some strange images.

![Western Icon of St. Katherine](/_assets/images/icon_st_katherine_western.jpg)

Why is she so big? What's with these midgets? Why are they so tiny? The overall sense of proportion does not match the actual dimensions of reality. But making it so would be a disservice- this is an icon of St. Katherine, not of the donors, so they are sized accordingly.

Alegria is distorted. But is it distorted choicefully? Honestly, it can't be.

## Art has Telos

What, pray tell, is the truth that Alegria is pointing towards? All it can be said to do is arouse the emotions, particularly that of comfort. The first image shows... friends? holding flowers? The goal of this style is clearly not to point to some truth or educate. It isn't even to train and align the emotions together. It is to mechanistically evoke a simple comfort.

Put bluntly, it's propoganda. Though "thesis" isn't the right word for most liturgical images, if Alegria had one, it would be Hedonism.

Why is her skin purple? Why is this guy's head a size too small? Why are his hands bigger than his head? Is this to symbolize that every single person is a bag, fat, small-brained, bumbling oaf? I'm not convinced that it is. At most, it's that way because it's 'cute' (which, unfortunately, tends to mean 'castrated').

To be fully fair- Alegria never set out to accomplish any of this. It set out to make you feel better about wasting your life in blue hell. But this is why it isn't artistic, and is mere graphic design.

## Generating Motifs

The subject of globohomo graphic design is never a particular person. It is always some hypothetical person. Not just some 'everyman', globohomo aims to represent a completely hypothetical and absurd person. Like it or not people don't identify with the human race. They identify with partiulars.

When we read an icon, we are inserting and bringing our contextual understanding of elements in the images, which enables a great deal of depth. Alegria has some of this at least insofar as it still has 'props' from the physical world. But some motifs come _from_ icons, not only _into_ icons. When's the last time you've physically seen a halo? Yet, you understand the halo motif, even if you have never had it explained to you.

Globohomo not only fails to accomplish this, it actively seeks to not produce patterns. We can't associate a stout build with strength- everyone is stoutly built. Color means nothing. Pick ANY aspect of a person, and you'll find that it doesn't correlate to anything throughout the style. This is _clearly_ a politically-correct-esque, deliberate, design choice. Emergent meanings have been deliberately written out.
