        <p>I think that there&rsquo;s plenty of folks like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_Dreher">Rod Dreher</a> (Author of The Benedict Option, and more lately, Live Not By Lies) who understand the new way things are going on the moral-religious landscape.. but let&rsquo;s crawl into it from a different angle.</p>

<p>The 20th century was bloody. We did a damn good job of that. And while many Christians have been right to identify the militant atheism at the core of Communism and Nazism as a central driving force, we have been slower to realize this.</p>

<p>Gulag-ing all the Christians doesn&rsquo;t work. You&rsquo;re playing right into their hands. Their whole story is based around being cut off from humanity, enduring ultimate sufferring, all the while being mocked and spit on, even being doubted by your own inner circle. Anyone who really believes that can&rsquo;t be controlled. They&rsquo;re immune. They&rsquo;ll go underground, they&rsquo;ll tell on you, go to any lengths. It&rsquo;s the ultimate resistance story. Their testimony shall be revered because of everything you have done.</p>

<p>That strategy won&rsquo;t work and we saw it play out in full force over the past century. So how do you really beat that narrative? Well for starters, you don&rsquo;t outright deny it.</p>

<p>But you can deny its significance. But, you can&rsquo;t do this outright. You can&rsquo;t full frontal say that religion isn&rsquo;t important. It mustn&rsquo;t be knocked down, other things must rise above. Civil Unions don&rsquo;t affect clerical celibacy. Inclusion isn&rsquo;t in competition with the Incarnation.</p>

<p>The communists made the grave mistake of declining Christianity a seat at the table. The bastard child will hunger strike until it&rsquo;s given. So give it. But he has to sit up straight and not speak out of turn.</p>

<p>This subconsciously ties into his understanding of worship as sacrifice, which is a deeply held notion that even we have. Do this slowly enough and they will not percieve it. Eventually they will come to value their participation at our table over their altars, at which point the proposition becomes so simple it doesn&rsquo;t even need to be made. They&rsquo;ll make it for themselves, a free will offerring to us.</p>

<p>Keep a seat open. Keep many seats open. Be willing to &lsquo;discourse&rsquo; and &lsquo;dialogue&rsquo;. But at your table. You invite them. You&rsquo;re the kind and compassionate host. The king opening the gates to the unwashed masses. You care. You want them to be heard. Do not get up from your chair. Do not talk to them in the wild. If they have a problem, they come to you. And you&rsquo;ve got them.</p>

<p>The Christian is obliged to turn the other cheek. So, do not slap them in the first place. Ignore them. Walk past them. The ultimate sufferring for such detestable creatures isn&rsquo;t torture, or even to be placed in solitary, but to wander in the desert without pain to endure.</p>
