        <p>The <a href="https://buck.co/work/facebook-alegria">Alegria</a> style has become something of a meme. Well, mocking it has. Some have dubbed it <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=globohomo+art&amp;t=h_&amp;iax=images&amp;ia=images">&lsquo;globohomo&rsquo; (globalist homogenization&hellip; but let&rsquo;s be frank, it&rsquo;s also an allusion to it being &lsquo;gay&rsquo;)</a> (use duckduckgo, not Google, for best results) and have memed it nicely. </p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/alegria_biden.jpg" alt="Sniff Sniff"></p>

<p>A huge portion of people&rsquo;s complaint over this style, is, make no mistake, the messenger: tech corporations (big, small, VC-backed, and all other shapes and sizes). The mom and pop diner down the street doesn&rsquo;t have these flat, disproportioned humanoids plastered over their walls.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yeah I like it as well, but I think its because its associated with big tech companies that try to be relatable with cringey captions such as &ldquo;we are all in this together&rdquo;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckalegriaart/">There&rsquo;s more on Reddit</a></p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/butttrumpet.png" alt="Not Monty Python."></p>

<p>But there&rsquo;s more to it than association. And it&rsquo;s not just about swoopy silly images. If there&rsquo;s one common braid among human &lsquo;art&rsquo; it&rsquo;s strange images. <a href="https://www.sadanduseless.com/tubas/">Everyone loves a good butt trumpet</a>. There&rsquo;s something else that makes Alegria mere graphic design, and not art. Comparing it to western art of the past 4-5 centuries, of course, is like comparing apples to oranges, though&hellip; we need more similar fruit.</p>
<h2>Realism?</h2>
<p>Art doesn&rsquo;t have to be realistic. Some of my favorite- the Byzantine style- is <em>notoriously</em> grotesque (at least, to the uninitated) and unrealistic. I&rsquo;m by no means an expert in iconography. I&rsquo;ll leave that <a href="https://orthodoxartsjournal.org/">to others</a>, but don&rsquo;t see a lot of people drawing the comparison between icons and Alegria so here we are.</p>

<p>The distortion of icons is something which serves a more practical purpose in the context of liturgical or divine images. You are probably familiar with the <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07620a.htm">iconoclast heresy</a> or at least understand the general idea of &lsquo;thou shalt not make graven images&rsquo;. We the viewers immediately recognize the distortion, and register that this is <em>not</em> the thing itself. It is a representation, or better yet, a <em>window</em> (a window to heaven, one might say).</p>
<h2>All Media is A Lens.</h2>
<p>All media is a window into the underlying subject. Even photography is a distortion of the subject insofar as we are given a particular exposure, framing, angle, depth-of-field, and so on. We will not grasp the whole subject. But grasping the subject in its entirety is a vain exercise: not every detail is important. Thus, distortion is not in and of itself bad. Distortion can be used to highlight and emphasize particular elements.</p>

<p>In the Byzantine (and pre-renaissance western) style, this is recognized quite explicity, as icons are &lsquo;windows into heaven&rsquo; (not divine, just ways by which we may make <em>real</em> contact with the divine). The key features which we must be mindful to are not worldly, but were made manifest in the world- as such, distortion should be embraced to magnify the divine, resulting in some strange images by photorealistic standards.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/icon_vladimir.jpg" alt="Icon of Our Lady of the Vladimir"></p>

<p>What&rsquo;s this baby doing with fully developed facial features? How&rsquo;s he reaching all the way around Our Lady&rsquo;s head? Why the long faces? This is clearly not a picture-perfect image. But making it so would be a disservice- Our Lord was the <em>Godhead</em> made incarnate, not just some infant. By placing the hand around her, it shows endearment and dependence towards Our Lady moreso that simply drawing close.</p>

<p>So distortion can be good. Alegria is distorted. But is it distorted choicefully? Honestly, it can&rsquo;t be.</p>
<h2>Art has Telos</h2>
<p>What, pray tell, is the truth that Alegria is pointing towards? All it can be said to do is arouse the emotions, particularly that of comfort. The first image shows&hellip; friends? holding flowers? The goal of this style is clearly not to point to some truth or educate. It isn&rsquo;t even to train and align the emotions together. It is to mechanistically evoke a simple comfort.</p>

<p>Put bluntly, it&rsquo;s propoganda. Though &ldquo;thesis&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t the right word for most liturgical images, if Alegria had one, it would be Hedonism.</p>

<p>Why is her skin purple? Why is this guy&rsquo;s head a size too small? Why are his hands bigger than his head? Is this to symbolize that every single person is a bag, fat, small-brained, bumbling oaf? I&rsquo;m not convinced that it is. At most, it&rsquo;s that way because it&rsquo;s &lsquo;cute&rsquo; (which, unfortunately, tends to mean &lsquo;castrated&rsquo;).</p>

<p>To be fully fair- Alegria never set out to accomplish any of this. It set out to make you feel better about wasting your life in blue hell. But this is why it isn&rsquo;t artistic, and is mere graphic design.</p>
<h2>Generating Motifs</h2>
<p>The subject of Alegria graphic design is never a particular person. It is always some hypothetical person. Not just some &lsquo;everyman&rsquo;, Alegria aims to represent a completely hypothetical and absurd person. Like it or not people don&rsquo;t identify with the human race. They identify with partiulars.</p>

<p>When we read an icon, we are inserting and bringing our contextual understanding of elements in the images, which enables a great deal of depth. Alegria has some of this at least insofar as it still has &lsquo;props&rsquo; from the physical world. But some motifs come <em>from</em> icons, not only <em>into</em> icons. When&rsquo;s the last time you&rsquo;ve physically seen a halo? Yet, you understand the halo motif, even if you have never had it explained to you.</p>

<p>Alegria not only fails to accomplish this, it actively seeks to not produce patterns. We can&rsquo;t associate a stout build with strength- everyone is stoutly built. Color means nothing. Pick ANY aspect of a person, and you&rsquo;ll find that it doesn&rsquo;t correlate to anything throughout the style. This is <em>clearly</em> a politically-correct-esque, deliberate, design choice. Emergent meanings have been deliberately written out.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s interesting to me is that when these meme-edits of Alegria art are produced, and inevitably reference real-world incarnations (see Biden meme above), they make <em>more sense</em> because they have a connection and a purpose. the connection and purpose <em>fills in the blanks</em> that exist within the minimalist art style. Icons don&rsquo;t need to be insanely complex- their belonging to a larger tradition causes the reader to (correctly, I might add) interpolate meaning into them.</p>
